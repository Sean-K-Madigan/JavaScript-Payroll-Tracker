# JavaScript-Payroll-Tracker

## Project Description

 Using JavaScript functions and the starter code provided I was tasked with developping an employee payroll tracker. This tracker will allow the user of the application can see their employees' names, alphabetically sorted, and pay rates to accurately budget company expenses. Along with this payroll tracker the program will display the calculate and display the average salary across all employees entered and randomly select and display one of those employees.
